# project_euler
This repository contains solutions to some of the Project Euler math/coding puzzles. 

From projecteuler.net : Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. 

As a mathematician, I find implementing efficient solutions to these problems interesting (and hard). I find it helpful (for myself) to write up fairly detailed notes about what I've learned in the process.

The solutions are in Python, but I may try coding them in other languages. Per Project Euler guidance, I will only include solutions to the first 100 problems.
