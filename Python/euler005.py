# Project Euler Problem 5
#
# 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
# What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all the numbers from 1 to 20?

# one could certainly use import math and python's lcm function.
# alternatively, this is easy to compute without a computer!
# lcm(1*2*...*10)=2*2*2*5*3*7*3=2520
# to get lcm(1*2*...*20), we only need a few more prime factors;
# lcm(1*2*...*20)=(2*2*2*5*3*7*3)*(11*13*2*17*19)=232792560

# we can instead make this work by computing the gcd via the euclidean algorithm
# if a=bq+r then gcd(a,b)=gcd(b,r); and gcd(a,0)=a.

# this will only return positive integers

    a = max(abs(num1), abs(num2))

        b = r
        r = a % b
    return b
