#Project Euler Problem 6
#
#The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 1^2+2^2+...+10^2 = 385
#The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is (1+2+...+10)^2 = 3025
#
#Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640
#
#Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

#this function just computes both numbers and subtracts them
