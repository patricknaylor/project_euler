# Project Euler Problem 4

# A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
# The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# 1000 isn't so large, so this can be solved by brute force
