#Project Euler Problem 15
#
#Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down,
#there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.
#How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

#some math helps us out a lot here! This is a standard counting question.
#re label things so that we start at the origin, and head out towards the point (20,20).
#The number of paths from (i,j) to the origin is the sum of the paths from (i+1,j) and (i,j+1)
#moreover, there's only one path from a point of the form (i,20) or (20,i).
#In other words, the number of paths is a pascal triangle! The number of paths from (i,j) to the origin is just i choose i+j

#thus the answer is 20 choose 40;
from math import comb

print("There are {} such paths.".format(comb(40,20)))

#The answer is equal to 137846528820
