# Project Euler Problem 25
#
# The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

# Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
# The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.
# What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
#

# store two terms, with their indices

current_term = [1, 2]
previous_term = [1, 1]


# this function will return the index of the first fibonacci number with that number of digits
