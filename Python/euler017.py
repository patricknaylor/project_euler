#Project Euler Problem 17
#
#f the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.
#If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?
#
#NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters.
#The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

#we will make a dictionary to store a number as a key, and the text version of that number as a value
#the first 20 or so values need to be hard coded, as do the multiples of 10 and 100
#everything else we won't add manually

#there is probably a more generic way to do this, but one would have to make some decisions about naming conventions with higher powers of 10
