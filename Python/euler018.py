# Project Euler Problem 18
# By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below,
# the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

# 3
# 7 4
# 2 4 6
# 8 5 9 3
#
# That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.
# Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:

# NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route.
# However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows;
# it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)

# we don't want to brute force this problem -- that will wind up being a lot of additions.
# instead, note that the paths are ordered-- they're in bijection with binary numbers less than 2^15.
# what we'll try to do is work our way through this space of paths, keeping track of the sum as we go.
# hopefully, this will be smart enough for Problem 67 (update: it isn't)

# first, we'll get the triangle using some list comprehension
